Bork Group Version 3B
List of Supplemental features:

Light: Some rooms are completely dark to the adventurer.  This is based off of how you set the Rooms in the bork file.  
You have the option for every room to select a light room or a dark room.  In these rooms you will not be able to see anything that exists.  


Locked Exit: Exits throughout the dungeon now may be locked.  You can set these exits to lock by commenting ‘lock’ or ‘unlock’ in the bork file.  
In order to gain access to these rooms you need to find the key!  When you stumble upon the key you ‘Use’ 
the key to grant yourself access through the exit, this will unlock the exit.

Combat: If the player encounters an enemy NPC, they will have a duel. Like in Pokemon, 
combat mode is a bit different from regular exploring mode. The player takes turns attacking and using items against the enemy NPC. 
If the player wins, they continue on with the game. If they lose and die, the game is over.

NPC: Non-player characters are computer-controlled characters that the player interacts with. So far, only enemies have been created. 

HelpCommand: An additional help command to detail all possible commands, say 'help' to activate it.

Player: A seperate singleton class that handles fighting methods, and updates the appropriate objects.
